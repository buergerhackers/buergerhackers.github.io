A quick and simple splashpage for launching a product idea and collecting emails


## Why Breadbox?

Breadbox is a super simple product splashpage. Breadbox is a great way to throw up a landing page, drive traffic, and capture interest and emails to test a market and validate an idea.

In it's base form, Breadbox is nothing more than a logo, product name, tagline, and email form. The page can be used as is, or easily be extended to include further information.

### In the Wild

The landing page method of Breadbox has been tested with interesting results. Using the base form with a logo, product name, and intriguing tagline accompanied with dispersal to a target market, Breadbox has returned a 30% conversion rate in email signups.

## How to Use

1. Clone, [Download](https://github.com/calebsylvest/breadbox/archive/master.zip), or [Fork](https://github.com/calebsylvest/breadbox/fork) Breadbox
2. Change relevant site content
	- Logo
	- Site Title
	- Tagline (this needs to be short, sweet, relevant, and intriguing)
	- Favicon
	- Header Meta
	- Footer info
3. Change any site styles, styles are built with Sass and Compass, so change variables in the `style.scss` file before making any code changes
	- Background Color
	- Font (be sure to link any CDN fonts in the site header)
	- Any other custom changes (check button text color, text color, etc)
4. Add email newsletter info. I prefer and use MailChimp, so the email form skeleton is straight from MailChimp. Simply add your unique list code to the `form` action to properly setup the signup field.
5. Add Google Analytics. Cause if there ain't analytics, then it didn't happen!
6. Launch into the real world.
